#### Tool description

This interactive tool is for researchers and designers to quickly estimate the efficiency of PACs and determine the needed number in a given room to meet the required efficiency.

To estimate the performance of the PACs in a given room, you need to first select the target pollutant, e.g., Ultrafine particles, PM2.5, PM10. The deposition rates of those types of particles are given as 1.64, 1.67, and 3.35 (1/h). 

Secondly, you need to type in the number of PACs in your space, and the [clean air delivery rate (CADR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_changes_per_hour) for each of them. Normally, you can find the CADR of the PAC in the product specification or user manual. Please note that please select the CADR according to the target pollutant.

The last step is to input the volume and air exchange rate of your space. You can either choose one from the typical room and ventilation types or type in manually if you have those information. 

This tool can be used to determine how many PACs are needed in your space. Similarly, instead of the PAC numbers as the known input parameter, you need to give a target efficiency. For office buildings that requires supplementary air cleaning, the minimum PAC effectiveness should be 50%. For enclosed air‚Äêconditioned office buildings without mechanical ventilation provision, the minimum PAC effectiveness should be 80%.
