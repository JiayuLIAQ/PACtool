#### Tool description

This interactive tool is for building managers, researchers, and designers to estimate the effectiveness of PACs or determine the needed number of units given the room size, ventilation rate, and the PAC’s [clean air delivery rate (CADR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_changes_per_hour).

To estimate the effectiveness of the PACs in a given room, you need to first type in the number of PACs, and the PM2.5 CADR. You can find the CADR of the PAC in the product specification, user manual, or from [the website of the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM)](https://www.ahamdir.com/room-air-cleaners/). Please note that [the AHAM AC-1 standard](https://ahamverifide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Testing-of-Portable-Air-Cleaner-Performance-FAQs-2020-Updates.pdf) uses Tobacco Smoke, Arizona Road Dust, Pollen, and PM2.5 to obtain their respective CADRs. Currently, not all PACs listed in the AHAM webpage have PM2.5 CADR data. For PACs without PM2.5 CADR, you may use the Dust CADR. Then, you need to input the volume and air exchange rate of your space. If the air exchange rates of a building are unknown, you may use the default values (default air exchange rate). The tool uses the air exchange rate data of office buildings from published research studies to provide a mean value derived from a Monte Carlo Simulation. For an enclosed air-conditioned office building without mechanical ventilation provision (i.e. fan coil units without fresh air, split unit air conditioning), you may use the default infiltration rate. The default infiltration rate was obtained from a Monte Carlo Simulation of the infiltration rate data from office buildings.

This tool can be used to determine how many PACs are needed in your space. Similarly, instead of the PAC numbers as the known input parameter, you need to give a target effectiveness. For office buildings that require supplementary air cleaning, the minimum PAC effectiveness should be 50%. For enclosed air‐conditioned office buildings without mechanical ventilation provision, the minimum PAC effectiveness should be 80%.
