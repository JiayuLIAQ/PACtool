#### Tool description

This interactive tool is for building managers, researchers and designers to quickly estimate the effectiveness of PACs or determine the needed number of units given the room size, ventilation rate and the PAC’s [clean air delivery rate (CADR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_changes_per_hour).

To estimate the performance of the PACs in a given room, you need to first select the particle type. For research purposes, the calculator allows three particle types: Ultrafine particles, PM2.5, PM10. The deposition rates of those types of particles are given as 1.64, 1.67, and 3.35 (1/h) as obtained from office building research literature. For general applications (e.g., building managers and designers), we recommend the use of PM2.5 CADR. Secondly, you need to type in the number of PACs in your space, and the CADR for each of them. You can find the CADR of the PAC in the product specification, user manual or from the AHAM website here. Please note that the AHAM AC-1 standard uses Tobacco Smoke, Arizona Road Dust, Pollen and PM2.5 to obtain their respective CADRs. Currently, not all PACs listed in the AHAM webpage have a PM2.5 CADR information as it is voluntary. For PACs without PM2.5 CADR in the webpage, you may use PM2.5 in the calculator as the particle type to represent Dust CADR. 

The last step is to input the volume and air exchange rate of your space. If the air exchange rates of a building are unknown, you may use the default values (default air exchange rate) obtained from the calculator. The calculator utilises the air exchange rate data of office buildings from published research studies to provide a mean value derived from a Monte Carlo Simulation. For an enclosed air-conditioned office building without mechanical ventilation provision (i.e. fan coil units without fresh air, split unit air conditioning), you may use the value (default infiltration rate) obtained from the calculator. The default infiltration rate is obtained from Monte Carlo Simulation of the infiltration rate data from office buildings. 

This tool can be used to determine how many PACs are needed in your space. Similarly, instead of the PAC numbers as the known input parameter, you need to give a target effectiveness. For office buildings that require supplementary air cleaning, the minimum PAC effectiveness should be 50%. For enclosed air‐conditioned office buildings without mechanical ventilation provision, the minimum PAC effectiveness should be 80%.
